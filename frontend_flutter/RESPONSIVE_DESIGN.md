## Implementation Details

### Screen Size Detection
```dart
final screenSize = MediaQuery.of(context).size;
final isSmallScreen = screenSize.width < 600;
final isMediumScreen = screenSize.width >= 600 && screenSize.width < 900;
final isLargeScreen = screenSize.width >= 900;
```

### Responsive Styling Pattern
```dart
Text(
  'Example Text',
  style: TextStyle(
    fontSize: isSmallScreen ? 14 : 16,
    fontWeight: FontWeight.w600,
  ),
)
```

### Adaptive Spacing
```dart
SizedBox(height: isSmallScreen ? 20 : 30),
padding: EdgeInsets.all(isSmallScreen ? 16 : 24),
```

### Responsive Test Screen
A dedicated test screen (`responsive_test_screen.dart`) has been created to:

### How to Test
1. Run the app on different devices/simulators
2. Rotate the device to test orientation changes
3. Use the responsive test screen to verify adaptations
4. Test the registration form on various screen sizes

## Best Practices Implemented
