# Authentication Flow Documentation

## 🔄 **Complete Authentication Flow**

### **Flow Overview:**
```
Registration → OTP Verification → Sign-In → Main Interface
```

---

## **📋 Step-by-Step Flow**

### **1. Registration Process**
- User fills out registration form with:
  - Email & Password
  - Business Type, Phone, Address
  - Role Selection (User/Shop Owner)
  - Terms & Conditions acceptance
- Form data is validated
- Email and password are sent to backend
- Additional form data is stored locally
- User is redirected to OTP verification screen

### **2. OTP Verification Process**
- User receives OTP via email
- User enters 6-digit OTP code
- Backend verifies the OTP
- **On Success:** 
  - Shows success message: "Account verified successfully! Please sign in."
  - Waits 2 seconds for message visibility
  - Redirects to Sign-In page with pre-filled email
- **On Failure:** Shows error message and allows retry

### **3. Sign-In Process**
- User arrives at Sign-In page with email pre-filled (from OTP verification)
- Shows success message: "Account verified successfully! Please sign in to continue."
- User enters password
- Backend validates credentials
- **On Success:**
  - Shows success message: "Login successful! Redirecting to main interface..."
  - Waits 1 second for message visibility
  - Redirects to Main Interface
- **On Failure:** Shows error message

### **4. Main Interface**
- User arrives at Home Screen
- Shows welcome message: "Welcome to ShopRadar! You are now in the main interface."
- Displays user account information
- Shows verification status with icons
- Ready for app features

## **🔧 Technical Implementation**

### **OTP Verification Screen (`otp_verification_screen.dart`)**
```dart
// On successful verification:
_showAnimatedMessage('Account verified successfully! Please sign in.', isSuccess: true);
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 2));

Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
  '/login',
  (route) => false,
  arguments: {
    'verifiedEmail': widget.email,
    'showSuccessMessage': true,
  },
);
```

### **Login Screen (`login_screen.dart`)**
```dart
// Handle verified email:
void _checkArguments() {
  final args = ModalRoute.of(context)?.settings.arguments as Map<String, dynamic>?;
  if (args != null) {
    _verifiedEmail = args['verifiedEmail'] as String?;
    _showSuccessMessage = args['showSuccessMessage'] as bool? ?? false;
    
    if (_verifiedEmail != null) {
      _emailController.text = _verifiedEmail!;
    }
  }
}

// On successful login:
_showAnimatedMessage('Login successful! Redirecting to main interface...', isSuccess: true);
await Future.delayed(const Duration(seconds: 1));

Navigator.of(context).pushNamedAndRemoveUntil(
  '/home',
  (route) => false,
);
```

### **Home Screen (`home_screen.dart`)**
```dart
// Show welcome message:
void _showWelcomeMessage() {
  MessageHelper.showAnimatedMessage(
    context,
    message: 'Welcome to ShopRadar! You are now in the main interface.',
    isSuccess: true,
  );
}
```
